    <!-- ******** SOME THINGS HAVE CHANGED WITH v1.0.4 ******** -->
    <!-- The antialias is now a property of the renderer component (line 20) -->
    <!-- The <a-animation> system was dismissed with the v0.9.0 release,
         and since then A-Frame started including the "animation" component
         in its core default components, so there is no more need to install
         any script to use it (line 23).
         You can learn more about the "animation" component in Section 7
         Lecture 31 "Animation component. Moreover, since some of the properties
         come with different names, you can find all their names and values
         on the official A-Frame documentation at this link:
         https://aframe.io/docs/1.0.0/components/animation.html -->
